Interval
========

This is an [interval arithmetic][] library for OCaml.

This library uses assembly code to compute all operations with proper
rounding, and currently **ONLY** works on Intel processors.
The package has been developed for Linux systems but
works on Windows when compiled with GCC.

To build the library, install jbuilder/[dune][] and type `jbuilder
build` in the main directory.  You can compile the examples with
`jbuilder build @examples`; the programs will be in
`_build/default/EXAMPLES/`.  To execute the tests, issue `jbuilder
runtest`).

To documentation is build using `jbuilder build @doc` and will be in
`_build/default/_doc/` in HTML format.  You can also consult the
interfaces of [Interval](src/interval.mli) and [Fpu](src/fpu.mli).
It is extremely wise to read the whole documentation, even if you
intend to only use the interval module.

Tests are available in the `TESTS/` directory.  They are mainly for
debugging purpose and quite complicated.  You may run them (`make
tests`) to check that everything is working properly for your machine.
The `test` program runs also a speed test for your particular
architecture.

Examples are available in the `EXAMPLES/` directory.  There is a
`B_AND_B` sub-directory with an example of a branch-and-bound
algorithm that uses interval arithmetics for function optimization
(the example is for the Griewank function, but you can substitute any
function you like).

Happy interval programming...
