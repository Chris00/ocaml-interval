An interval library for OCaml

This library uses assembly code to compute all operations with proper
roundings, and currently ONLY works on intel processors.  It supports
Linux, Windows and MacOs, with gcc and clang.  Unfortunately, the Intel
processor does not properly round trigonometric functions so this library
cannot be used whenever proved correct enclosures are needed.

More information is given in the paper presented in the OCaml meeting
