An interval library for OCaml (crlibm version)

This library uses assembly code to compute all operations with proper
roundings, and currently ONLY works on intel processors.

This package uses CRlibm (a proved correctly rounded mathematical
library) to provide enclosures of transcendental functions.  It can be
40â€“60% slower than the version using the implementation in the CPU but
the bounds are proved correct.  It also provides *pi versions of the
trigonometric functions and their inverse.
